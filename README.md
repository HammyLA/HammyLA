## Hi there 👋
`2 Minute Read`

Hello :) I am Lawrence 👍 thank you for checking out my account page thing.

I'm studying for finals right now 😪, but I'm going to start working on a few projects over the summer 🏖️. If you find have anything interesting 👀 to work on, message me I'd love to see.

## Me

🤔 - I would like to do some research work, so I'm "researching" how to get started. Currently reading papers on malware classification.

🔨 - I'm gonna work on a few projects soon. Look out for: Chronologia 🗺️, Jarvis 🤖, some sort of ancient text reader 🪦 (i want to work on history projects :D )

I'm going to update this as I go along or whatever comes to mind idk. Maybe I will make it look really nice 👍
